- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Intepreting user needs can be done with field study and surveys. Getting real answers from people that will use the product and why they want the features they want is imperitive to a successful project. User stories are great because they help the scrum team understand what they need to do in order to deliver a desireable product.

- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing looking for efficiency and to create a program that will improve the users life in some way. Agile processes I hope to incorporate transparency and communication efficiency.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means sharing knowledge, and being a good communicator. I think that even if you are not great at writing code but you are able to learn and cooperate with a team, then you can become a good developer.
